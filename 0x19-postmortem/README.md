# Incident Report: Backend Infrastructure Outage
> This report is a postmortem on the failure of our backend services to handle requests, happened on the date: May 5, 2024.

## Issue Summary:

From 10:12 AM GMT to 11:25 AM GMT, all user actions on our website and mobile app (that involved an API call) were unsuccessful. Requests made were unresponsive and ended in a 408 "Request Timeout" error, affecting 90% of our total traffic for the outage period. The root cause of this issue was a configuration change which initiated a firewall reset, denying HTTP/HTTPS access to the load balancers.

## Timeline (all in GMT):

* **10:05 AM:** Changes were made to the configurations of our load balancer.
    
* **10:12 AM:** Outage begins.
    
* **10:15 AM:** Monitoring service alerted on-call engineer.
    
* **10:23 AM:** Problem pinpointed to be from the load balancers.
    
* **10:49 AM:** Rolled back recent configuration changes (requests remained unsuccessful.)
    
* **11:07 AM:** Firewall was identified as root cause of issue.
    
* **11:16 AM:** HTTP and HTTPS ports manually allowed in firewall config.
    
* **11:18 AM:** Load Balancer restarted.
    
* **11:25 AM:** Requests from clients 100% successful.
    

## Root Cause:

At 10:05 AM GMT, a routine configuration change was made to the load balancer's environmental variables. This change then led to the updating of outdated packages on the load balancer, of which the firewall package was one. The update caused a reset in the firewall settings, taking it back to its default (which does not allow for HTTP and HTTPS naturally).

With the HTTPS/HTTP ports blocked by the firewall, requests from our web and mobile applicationsâ€”both using HTTPSâ€”could not go through. This led to the outage that began around 10:12 AM GMT.

## Resolution and recovery:

At 10:15 AM GMT, the monitoring service alerted the on-call engineer over a low preset limit reached at responses delivered over requests made. This, alongside a spike in the amount of user complaints, made the engineer escalate the issue as soon as it happened.

After successfully sending requests to the servers directly without any problems, it was discovered that the main culprit behind the issue was the load balancer. Checking the logs of the load balancer revealed a recent routine automated configuration change, and it was assumed that the change was the root cause. A rollback of the configuration state was attempted at 10:49 AM GMT.

The rollback was successful, but requests made were still failing. After further checks, it was found that the firewall was blocking requests to the HTTP and HTTPS ports. This was resolved by manually adding the ports to the firewall configuration.

The load balancer was restarted at 11:18 AM GMT, and after the reboot was completed at 11:25 AM GMT, resolved requests from clients were back at a 100% success rate.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

After a review of the incident, actions that we believe will address the underlying cause of the issue and will help prevent future recurrences are:

* Adding automated checks that detect changes in the load balancer's environment.
    
* Running checks after any configuration change in both the servers and the load balancer (whether the change is considered routine or not).
    
* Adding vital ports to the firewall default settings.
